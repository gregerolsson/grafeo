//! Block descriptors for columnar storage.
//!
//! A "block" is a logical chunk of a column's rows that can be skipped or
//! processed as a unit. Blocks bridge raw codec output (bit-packed
//! integers, dictionary-encoded strings, boolean bitmaps, etc.) and
//! higher-level scan operators that want to prune work using per-block
//! summary statistics.
//!
//! This module lives in `codec` rather than under any particular store
//! because both [`graph::compact::ColumnCodec`](crate::graph::compact::column::ColumnCodec)
//! (the read-only columnar base) and the LPG store's `PropertyColumn`
//! (the mutable in-memory store, modernized later in Phase 2) describe
//! their data using the same block descriptors.
//!
//! # Phasing
//!
//! Phase 2a introduces the descriptor type and the enumeration API on
//! `ColumnCodec`; every column today reports a single block covering
//! all rows. Phase 2b will introduce multi-block serialization, and
//! Phase 2c will add per-block statistics (min/max/null/row counts,
//! optional bloom) so range scans can skip blocks whose stats prove
//! no match. Phase 2d/2e extend the same descriptors to LpgStore.
//!
//! The split is deliberate: Phase 2a keeps the data layout untouched so
//! upstream readers can be extended block-aware before any on-disk
//! format changes.

///
/// Chosen so a `BitPacked` column with `bits_per_value == 4` fills exactly
/// 64 `u64` words per block (4 KiB); other widths land within ~1 KiB of
/// the same target. Per-block stats (Phase 2c) and iterator early-stop
/// (Phase 4) get coarse-but-useful skip granularity at this size without
/// blowing up the block-index footprint.
