//! Page-fetching abstraction for tiered storage.

//! Provides an indirection layer that lets sections receive paged byte
//! access without knowing whether the bytes come from a memory-mapped
//! file, an explicit buffer pool, or some other source. The mmap-backed
//! implementation lives in `grafeo-storage`; future implementations may
//! include vmcache (TUM, 2024) or an explicit pager with pointer
//! swizzling (LeanStore, VLDB 2024).
//!
//! See `docs/architecture/storage/disk-storage-decisions.md` for the
//! rationale (decision D1).
