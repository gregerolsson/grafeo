"""Tests for db.execute_lazy() cursor-based query streaming.

Focus:
- Iterator protocol yields the same rows as db.execute()
- Early break drops the stream cleanly (subsequent queries still work)
- Columns are exposed before iteration starts
- Empty results behave like normal empty iterators
- Non-streamable queries (mutations, ORDER BY, session cmds, EXPLAIN) raise
- GIL is released during chunk pulls: other Python threads make progress
